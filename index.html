    <h1> Welcome to APCSP Spring 2023 </h1>
      <h2> About Me</h2>
      <h4> I am currently a senior at Westview High Scool with a graduation date of June 9. I was a two year varsity athlete on the track and field team, specializing in the Pole Vault. I was involved with track all four years of high school.
      <br>
      I will be attending San Diego Mesa College in the fall in order to continue progressing in the pole vault with aspirations to transfer into a D1 track program for my last 2-3 years.
        <br> 
        I have future goals to pursue a career in civil law either working through the ladder to become the general counsel for a cooperation or own my own firm.
        <br>
