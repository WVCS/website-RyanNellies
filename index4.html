<h2> NEW YORK TIMES GAMES</h2>
<h4> In this class we enjoy daily competitions by competing in The Daily Wordle, The Mini Crossword, and any other game that seems to be appealing that day. These competitions have led to many friendships in the back right corner of the class. Our four seniors got close because of this and made the class much more enjoyable and made this semester fly by much faster than it would've without them. As we approach graduation I have found myself more and grateful for this class every day.</h4>
